ebardwel

Hello and welcome to project 1. Around here you should be able to find 3
executables ebardwel_p1 ebardwel_p2 and ebardwel_p3 that run the three programs we were asked to make. executables were
made with PYinstaller. pseudo code is in the pdf file labeled pseudo. 
As add is commutative I don't need to actually add all of them just every combination of them without repitition.
