Over the course of a semester my team of 4 was charged with creating a 
SRS document that reflects the needs and wants of a customer on an application
similar to that of Nextdoor. The customer was played by other students
who we had to get the information for the application from. We went 
through many iterations and changes that lead to the final product.
